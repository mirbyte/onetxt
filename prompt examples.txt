you could attach one of these to the beginning of the conversation, feel free to edit to your own needs:


The attached text file(s) contain multiple sources separated with XML tags; synthesize across sections and cite evidence inline with square brackets using the document id and a minimal locator: prefer section headings [id=filename.txt §Heading], then paragraph numbers [id, ¶3], then line ranges [id, lines 120–138], or just document id for short sources [id]. If a claim spans multiple files, chain citations like [id, §2][id, lines 45–52], and if a detail isn't present, state that briefly before giving best‑effort guidance. Understood?


The attached text file(s) contain multiple documents merged with <doc id="name"> XML tags. Analyze and synthesize information across all sources, identifying patterns, connections, and contrasts between documents. When citing evidence, use square brackets with the document ID and specific locators: [id, §section], [id, lines 85-92], or [id, p.3]. For claims spanning multiple sources, chain citations: [id, §intro][id, lines 45-50]. When information conflicts between sources, present both perspectives with citations. If specific details are unavailable, state this clearly before providing contextual guidance from related content. Understood?
